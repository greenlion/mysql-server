WarpSQL is a GPL v2 open source distribution of MySQL. WarpSQL is not 
intended to be a hard fork of MySQL like MariaDB, but is more like 
Percona Server, which is an enhanced MySQL server which strives to be 
nearly 100% compatible with upstream MySQL.

WARP storage engine
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WarpSQL currently ships the WARP storage engine.  The WARP storage engine 
is a columnar storage engine with compressed bitmap indexes, and is based
on Fastbit 2.0.3, the latest version of Fastbit.  Fastbit is a mature
NoSQL column store with a C++ interface with an lgpl license.  WarpSQL is 
an adaptation of Fastbit to the MySQL database pluggable storage engine
interface.  WARP both horizontally and vertically partitions data sets
automatically.  Standard MySQL partitioning is not yet supported. 
Data compression is not yet supported.
